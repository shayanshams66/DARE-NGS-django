        A theme for Pinax based on the open source Bootstrap front-end framework and
        the Font Awesome icon library.
        
        
        Upgrade Notes
        -------------
        
        Upgrading to 6.0, you should be aware of a few changes:
        
        * `style_base` and `extra_style` blocks have been merged into `styles`
        * `script_base` and `extra_script` blocks have been merged into `scripts` and
          the `theme.js` script is now loaded within a `theme_script` block after the
          `scripts` block. It now expects that you'll load the necessary `jQuery`
          library at the project level in the `scripts` block.
        * No vendored assets ship with the theme anymore. You are responsible for
          setting up your own static assets at the project level. We have made it easy
          by just using one of our starter projects.
        
        
        Dependencies
        ------------
        
        * Bootstrap
        * Font Awesome
        * jQuery
        
        We previously vendored these packages and had an undocumented build process
        pre-configured in our starter projects that use this theme. This has gone the
        way of the 80s hair band and we are now using proper packaging in the starter
        projects.
        
        The templates in this project are currently tested with the following versions:
        
        * Bootstrap 3.3.5
        * Font Awesome 4.4.0
        * jQuery 2.1.4
        
        If you are not using one of our starter projects, you will need to go about
        setting up a build environment to use these libraries. We recommend using
        `webpack <http://webpack.github.io/>`_ and installing these libraries with
        `npm`.
        
        
        Quick Start
        -----------
        
        Include "pinax-theme-bootstrap" in your requirements file and include
        "pinax_theme_bootstrap" and "bootstrapform" (which is installed alongside
        this theme) in your INSTALLED APPS.
        
        Add 'django.core.context_processors.request' and
        "pinax_theme_bootstrap.context_processors.theme" to your TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS
        to ensure the user selector and site name work correctly.
        
        Make sure both template loaders and staticfiles finders includes
        app directories.
        
        Site name comes from Sites fixture.
        
        Your "site_base.html" should extend "theme_bootstrap/base.html" and should provide
        "footer" and "nav" blocks (the latter should just be a ul of li of a links).
        
        Your pages should have blocks "head_title" and "body" and should extend
        "site_base.html".
        
        The url name "home" should be defined as the homepage.
